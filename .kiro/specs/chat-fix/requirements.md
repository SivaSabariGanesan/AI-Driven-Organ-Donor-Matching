# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LifeMatch organ donation platform has a chat feature that is currently failing. Users are experiencing "Chat failed" errors when attempting to use the AI-powered medical triage and organ donation guidance chatbot. The system needs to be diagnosed and fixed to restore reliable chat functionality.

## Glossary

- **Chat_System**: The AI-powered chatbot that provides medical triage and organ donation guidance using Google's Gemini API
- **Frontend_Client**: The web browser interface where users interact with the chat
- **Backend_API**: The Express.js server that handles chat requests and communicates with the Gemini API
- **Authentication_Middleware**: The system component that verifies user tokens before allowing chat access
- **Google_API**: The external Google Generative AI service used to generate chat responses
